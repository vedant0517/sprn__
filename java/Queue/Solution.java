/**
 * Solution
 *
 * Generates and prints binary representations for numbers 1..N.
 * Algorithm: BFS-style generation using a queue of strings.
 * Start with "1" and repeatedly:
 *  - take the front string s,
 *  - print s (this corresponds to next binary number),
 *  - enqueue s+"0" and s+"1" which become later binary numbers.
 *
 * Example (queue contents shown after each enqueue):
 *   start: ["1"]
 *   step1: print "1", enqueue "10","11" -> ["10","11"]
 *   step2: print "10", enqueue "100","101" -> ["11","100","101"]
 *   ...
 *
 * Complexity: O(N) time (each step does constant work + two enqueues)
 *             O(N) space for the queue and stored strings.
